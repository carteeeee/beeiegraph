    "content": "Despite his original plans, Christopher continued working on the hack as a result of his disappointment with the sluggish progress of B3313's decomp port.\nIt also happens to be the last version of B3313 that can be edited by binary tools such as SM64 Rom Manager and Quad64 normally.\nThis version added a lot more content, but actually happened to be a development rom. It was specifically selected for release later as it was the last console compatible build.\nIt also adds Personalization Values, or PVs which will \"personalize\" the user's game by changing up enemies, difficulty levels, etc.\nThere is a whopping 45 new areas in this build, which I am not going to write down here.
